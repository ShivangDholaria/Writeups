# Local Target

## Overview

Points: 100

Category: Binary Exploitation

## Description
Smash the stack

Can you overflow the buffer and modify the other local variable? The program is available `here`. You can view source `here`. And connect with it using: `nc saturn.picoctf.net 53596`

## Hints (if any)
1. Do anything you can to change `num`.
2. When you change `num`, view the value as hexadecimal.

## Approach
A classic binary exploitation attack. As mentioned in the description, we need to attack the program stack and modify the value of `num` to get our flag.

Lets start up the instance and see how the machine works.

We see that even if the input length and initial starting characters are different, we get our output as `num is 64`. Empty input and special character input too give the same result.

Now lets see what the source code is.

Code looks simple but value of `num` is hard coded to 64. We somehow need to change it 65, so that we can reach to the flag file.

So lets try overflow the buffer of the program.

After trying different input size, `a` with length of 24 is the maximun limit for buffer after which the buffer get's overflowed with the remaining values.

We also notice that 64 is the ascii value for the character `@`. So 65 would be character for `A`. Now we know what we need to do. Just add an `A` after the input string to get the flag!
